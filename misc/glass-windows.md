After seeing that strings doesn't contain the flag, I checked the description and the picture and it seems that flag was in the picture.

So test my hypothesis, I used a tool called *stegsolve* which helps see different colors of that picture.

While playing around with the stegsolve, I was getting warmer to the flag when I saw the text.

I found the clear picture of the flag at **Red Plane 0**(this is half of the flag)


`flag{p1te_chucks_remind_me_of_gifs}`

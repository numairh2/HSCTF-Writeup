## Solution
I first check Strings command! Sometimes it safes alot of time

By looking at what strings gave us, the flag is not in there.

I next look at the title, LSBlue... I saw LSB, which means 'least-significant bit', and it means that flag is under LSB.

After looking at different CTFs, I saw Zsteg which is a tool that detect stego-hidden data in PNG & BMP file extensions

After running Zsteg

The flag was hidden in the LSB data

`flag{0rc45_4r3nt_6lue_s1lly_489131}`
